CAKE is a JavaScript scene graph library for the HTML5 canvas tag. You could think of it as SVG sans the XML and not be too far off.  
Released under the MIT license.  

The original repository is located at http://code.google.com/p/cakejs/  
  
** ATTENTION **  
This project is work in progress.  
The splitted files are broken and the need a namespace.  
If you want to use the plain old cakejs use the file located in the dist folder.
